<p>In this project you will classify five different stars according to the Harvard Classification Scheme</p>
<p></p>
<p>O B A F G K M</p>
<p></p>
<p>The description of different classes is given below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>'O'</strong> type stars are very hot and bluish in color. Their surface temperature ranges from 40000 K to 20000 K. Due to the high temperature they show strong absorption and sometimes emission lines from different ions such as <em>HeII, CIII, NIII, OIII, SiIV</em> and <em>SiV</em> as well as from neutral Helium atom HeI. The HI Balmer lines are visible but weak. An example of this star which can be seen by naked eye is Meissa which lies in the constellation Orion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br /> The <strong>'B'</strong> type stars are also very hot with surface temperature ranging from 20000 K to 10000 K. They are also blue in color. Their spectra show neutral Helium lines, which are strongest at <strong>'B2'</strong>. One also sees lines from ions such as <em>OII, SiII, MgII</em>. the HI Balmer lines are relatively strong. An example of a <strong>'B'</strong> type star is <strong>Rigel</strong>, which is the brightest star in constellation Orion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>'A'</strong> type stars are white in color and have surface temperature ranging from 10000 K to 7500 K. These have very strong Hydrogen HI lines.The lines of ions such as <em>MgII, SiII. The CaII </em> can be observed but they are weak. An example of an <strong>'A'</strong> type star is <strong>Sirius</strong> in constellation Canis Major, which is the brightest star in night sky.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>'F'</strong> type stars have surface temperature in the range 7500 K to 6000 K and have a yellow-white color. The HI lines are getting weaker but still relatively strong. <em>CaII</em> and <em>FeII</em> lines start gettign stronger. Neutral metal lines (<em>FeII</em>) and <em>CaI</em> also becoming visible. An example is <strong>Canopus</strong> in constellation Carina. It is the second brightest star in the night sky.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>'G'</strong> type are yellow stars with surface temperature toughly in the range 6000 K to 4500 K. Here the HI lines are weak. <em>CaII</em> lines continue to become stronger. <em>FeII</em> lines strong. <em>FeI, CaI</em> lines becoming stronger. Sun is a <strong>'G2'</strong> type star. Another example is <strong>Alpha Centauri A</strong> in constellation Centaurus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>'K'</strong> type are orange stars with surface temperature in the range 4500 K to 3600 K. The HI lines are now very weak. The spectrum is dominated by metal absorption lines. <em>CaII</em> lines very strong. The neutral metal lines <em>FeI, SiI</em> visible. The molecular bands of <em>TiO</em> become visible by<strong> 'K5'</strong>. An example is<strong> Aldebaran</strong> in the constellation Taurus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>'M'</strong> type stars are cool red stars with surface temperature less than 3600 K. Here the spectra is dominated by <em>TiO</em> bands and neutral metal (<em>FeI</em>) lines. The HI lines are absent. <em>CaI</em> lines are also very strong. An example is <strong>Betelgeuse</strong> in the constellation Orion.</p>

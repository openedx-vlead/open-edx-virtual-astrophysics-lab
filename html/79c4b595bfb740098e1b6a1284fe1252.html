<p>Circumpolar means to circle around the pole. Circumpolar star is a star that never sets (that is, it never disappears below the horizon at all times, irrespective of day and night or year), as seen from a given latitude, due to its proximity to one of the celestial poles. They move in a counterclockwise direction. However it is not visible during the day because of sunshine. Designation of a star as circumpolar depends on the observer's latitude. At either of Earth's poles all stars of that hemisphere are circumpolar, whereas at the equator none are, since only one half of the celestial sphere can ever be seen. For an observer (with a latitude <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\small \phi}</span>), a star whose declination is greater than <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\small 90^\circ-\phi}</span> will be circumpolar, appearing to circle the celestial pole and remaining always above the horizon. However, there will be some stars which can never be seen beyond a certain latitude.</p>

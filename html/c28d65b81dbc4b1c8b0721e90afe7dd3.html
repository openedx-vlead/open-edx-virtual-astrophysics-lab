<p>Far the purpose of this experiment, we shall make a few assumptions. Firstly, we shall take the orbits of all planets to be circular. This assumption is fairly accurate for most planets. The most eccentric orbit is that of Mercury <span class="MathJax_Preview">(e=0.2)</span>, But even there we shall see that the calculated distance is close to the actual value. Secondly, we assume that the solar system is entirely planar. This is also fairly accurate, with the exception of that of mercury (~<span class="MathJax_Preview">{\small 7^\circ}</span>).</p>

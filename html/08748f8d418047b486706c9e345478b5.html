<li>Step 1: Choose any three stars sufficiently close to the zenith. (Their zenith distance must be greater than <span class="MathJax_Preview">{80^\circ}</span>.) You can turn on the zenith circles using the key 'Z' if you wish.</li>
<li>Step 2: Note down the altitudes, a, of these three stars. 90-a will give us their zenithal distances, <span class="MathJax_Preview">z_1</span>, <span class="MathJax_Preview">z_2</span>, and <span class="MathJax_Preview">z_3</span></li>
<li>Step 3: Write down the RA and declination of these three stars.</li>
<li>Step 4: Read and note the date and time.</li>
<li>Step 5: Use the information from Steps 3 and 4 to determine the sub stellar point of the three stars.</li>
<li>Step 6: Get a map of a certain region of the earth. All three of your substellar points should be on this map. </li>
<li>Step 7: Mark off all three substellar points on the map.</li>
<li>Step 7: Draw a circle with the centre at the substellar point, and radius equal to the zenithal distance of that particular star. Do this for all three stars</li>
<li>Step 8: Ideally all the circles should intersect at exactly one point. This point is the observer location. Read off its co-ordinates.</li>
<li>Step 9: If the circles do not intersect exactly, then read off the centroid of the three points of intersection. This is the observer location.</li>

<li>Step 1: Note down the current latitude(<span class="MathJax_Preview">{\phi_{1}}</span>) and longitude of the current location. (F6)</li>
<li>Step 2: Find the Moon. (Use Ctrl+F for search)</li>
<li>Step 3: Advance or retreat the time using keys J and L, until the azimuth of the Moon is either <span class="MathJax_Preview">{0^\circ}</span> or <span class="MathJax_Preview">{180^\circ}</span></li>
<li>Step 4: Pause the time. (Press K)</li>
<li>Step 5: Note down the altitude. This angle subtracted from <span class="MathJax_Preview">{90^\circ}</span> will give us the observed zenithal distance <span class="MathJax_Preview">{z_{10}}</span></li>
<li>Step 6: Change the location to another place, maintaining the same longitude. Note down the new latitude <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\phi_{2}}</span> (F6)</li>
<li>Step 7: Notice that the moon is already on the meridian. Note down the altitude of the moon. This angle subtracted from <span class="MathJax_Preview">{90^\circ}</span> will give us the observed zenithal distance <span class="MathJax_Preview">{z_{20}}</span></li>
<li>Step 8: Use Eqn. 6 to find angle <span class="MathJax_Preview">P</span></li>
<li>Step 9: The Inverse of sine of P should give the distance to the moon in earth radii.</li>

<p><b>CAUTION: Please note that:</b> We take all angles as positive counterclockwise and negative clockwise.Further latitude in northern hemisphere is taken positive and in southern hemisphere is negative. Here in Fig 3, <span class="MathJax_Preview">{z_{1}}</span> and <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\phi_{1}}</span> are positive and <span class="MathJax_Preview">{z_{2}}</span> and <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\phi_{2}}</span> are negative.</p>

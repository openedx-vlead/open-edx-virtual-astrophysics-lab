<p>Most stars move slowly with respect to Sun in a direction which does not change significantly with time. The angular velocity of the star with respect to the Sun is called proper velocity. The largest known proper motion is that of Barnard's star which moves across the sky at a speed of <span class="MathJax_Preview">10.3"</span> per year. Here you will measure the proper velocity of Bernard star using Stellarium.</p>

<p>In this experiment we shall measure the distance of various planets from the sun. Two different techniques shall be employed here. One for the internal planets, and the other for the external planets. Both will rely on the measurement of a certain parameter known as the elongation of the planet. This shall be measured by noting the coordinates of the planets on the ecliptic co-ordinate system.</p>

<li>Step 1: Remove the Atmosphere and Ground. (Press A and G) </li>
<li>Step 2: Locate and center on the Sun. (Use Ctrl+F to open the search window)</li>
<li>Step 3: Zoom out until Mercury is also visible. (Ctrl + Down arrow) </li>
<li>Step 4: Switch to Equatorial mount. (Ctrl + M) </li>
<li>Step 5: Increase the time 1 day at a time and go to the day when it appears that Mercury is furthest from the sun. (Use =) </li>
<li>Step 6: Enable the "Angle Measure" Plug-in. (Ctrl+A) </li>
<li>Step 7: Measure the angle from the Sun to Mercury. </li>
<li>Step 8: Measure the angle for a few hours around that time, so as to get the maximum elongation, correct to the time of an hour </li>
<li>Step 9: Use Equation 1 to calculate the Sun Mercury distance</li>

<p>For example, doing the above steps with mercury gives <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\varepsilon}</span> to be around <span class="MathJax_Preview">25^\circ</span> <span class="MathJax_Preview">20</span>'. This puts the Sun Mercury distance to 0.42 A.U. This has roughly a 10% error. Note that since this is the most eccentric orbit, hence all of our errors for the remaining planets must be less than 10%. Also remember that <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\varepsilon}</span> is not constant and varies slightly in different revolutions.</p>

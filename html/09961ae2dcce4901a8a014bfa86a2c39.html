<p>Let S denote the Sun, P denote the planet, and E denote the Earth. Let us consider a frame of reference rotating with an angular velocity equal to that of the earths revolutionary motion. In this frame the line SE will be fixed. Now, the planet P, could be anywhere on the inner circle as shown in Fig 1. We define <span class="MathJax_Preview">\angle SEP</span> to be the Elongation of planet P. Note that in the case of an inner planet the elongation cannot attain all values. It can attain all values ranging from <span class="MathJax_Preview">{0^\circ}</span> until a certain maximum. Note that this maximum will be attained when the line EP will be tangent to the the inner circle as shown in Fig 1. Let us denote this maximum elongation by <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\varepsilon}</span></p>
<p>Now we see that <span class="MathJax_Preview">\begin{eqnarray} \sin \varepsilon &amp;=&amp; \frac{SP}{SE}\\ \Rightarrow SP &amp;=&amp; \sin \varepsilon \times SE \end{eqnarray}</span> Since SE is nothing but 1 Astronomical Unit(A.U.), thus we get the distance of the planet from the sun in Astronomical Units.</p>
<p>To measure the angle <span class="MathJax_Preview">{\varepsilon}</span> we shall make use of a plug-in called "Angle Measure". This can be enabled in the configuration window.</p>

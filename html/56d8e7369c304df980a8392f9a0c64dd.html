<p>In this experiment we will get familiar with the spectra of different stars. You will be given a set of five spectra at random corresponding to five different stars from a large sample of spectral data given below. You will identify the spectral lines in each of these data sets and correlate it with the reference sample of lines. On the basis of the observed spectral lines you will make a broad classification of these stars according to the Harvard Classification scheme OBAFGKM.</p>

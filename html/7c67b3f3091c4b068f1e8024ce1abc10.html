<p>In order to understand how to measure the distance to a superior planet, we must first understand the concept of a Synodic period. This is defined as the time between two successive similar configuration of the Sun, Planet, Earth System. For example, 2 successive similar configurations of a general superior planet with the earth is shown in Fig 2. Let us try to understand this better. Let the synodic period of the planet P be Sy. Let the time period of revolution of the Earth be <span class="MathJax_Preview">T_E</span>, and that of the Planet P be <span class="MathJax_Preview">T_P</span>. Since the Earth is interior, the earth will revolve faster than planet P. By the Time the Earth takes one complete revolution the planet P will have moved further ahead. The earth would have to move a little further ahead up to position <span class="MathJax_Preview">E_2</span> to recover the same configuration.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Let the angular velocity of the Earth be <span class="MathJax_Preview">n_E = 2\pi / T_E</span>, and similarly that for the planet P be <span class="MathJax_Preview">n_P = 2 \pi/T_P</span>. Now, as the <span class="MathJax_Preview">n_E &gt; n_P</span> the radius vector <span class="MathJax_Preview">SE</span> will gain on the radius vector <span class="MathJax_Preview">SP</span> at a rate of <span class="MathJax_Preview">n_E-n_P</span>. In one synodic period the radius vector SE shall gain on the vector <span class="MathJax_Preview">SP</span> by <span class="MathJax_Preview">2 \pi</span> radians.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="MathJax_Preview">\begin{eqnarray} &amp;&amp;Sy \times (n_E - n_P)&amp;=&amp; 2\pi\\ &amp; \Rightarrow &amp; n_E - n_P &amp;=&amp; 2 \pi / Sy\\ &amp; \Rightarrow &amp; 2\pi /T_E - 2\pi / T_P &amp;=&amp; 2\pi /Sy\\ &amp; \Rightarrow &amp; 1/Sy &amp;=&amp; 1/T_E - 1/T_P \end{eqnarray}</span> Note that Sy is a quantity that can be measured easily by an observer on earth.</p>
<p>Now, to measure the distance of the planet P to the Sun, we shall start our observations at opposition, i.e. when the elongation is <span class="MathJax_Preview">180^\circ</span>. This corresponds to situation 1 in Fig 2. Now we take our next observation after some time <span class="MathJax_Preview">t</span>, at situation 2. In this time the elongation has increased from <span class="MathJax_Preview">0^\circ</span> to <span class="MathJax_Preview">\theta</span> at a angular velocity of <span class="MathJax_Preview">n_E - n_P</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="MathJax_Preview">\begin{eqnarray} \theta &amp;=&amp; (n_E-n_P) \times t\\ &amp;=&amp; t \times (2 \pi/T_E - 2\pi/T_P)\\ &amp;=&amp; 2\pi \times t/S_y\\ \end{eqnarray}</span></p>
<p>Thus the angle theta can be calculated. Now, <span class="MathJax_Preview">\angle PES</span> can be measured from the sky. Thus we can now also calculate <span class="MathJax_Preview">\angle EPS</span>. Thus, using sine rule,</p>
<p><span class="MathJax_Preview">\begin{eqnarray} \frac{\sin \angle EPS}{SE} = \frac{\sin \angle PES}{SP} \end{eqnarray}</span></p>
<p>Thus we can calculate the distance to superior planets.</p>

<p>The spectral graphs given below are generated from spectral data of various stars. A sample of these data set is given below.</p>

<p><br /> You may download these files and plot them using your favorite graphing program to get some familarity with data. This step is not essential since we directly give the plots of these data sets below. In each data file the first column is wavelength in Angstroms and the second column is flux. Ignore the remaining columns. An example of this plot is given below. The stellar spectra is shown in red.</p>
<p>You will be expected to correlate the absorbtion lines with those provided in the <a href="http://va-iitk.vlabs.ac.in/data/expt5/ReferenceSpecralLine.txt" target="_blank">reference list</a> of various atomic spectral lines. These reference lines are also shown (in green) in the plot for easy identification. </p>
